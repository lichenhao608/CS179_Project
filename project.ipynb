    "SVD is a matrix factorization technique that is usually used to reduce the number of features of a data set by reduing the space dimensions from N to K. When it is used in the collaborative filtering, it can help us to learn the latent preferences of users and the latent attributes of items from known rating. Latent variables are those not shown in the data. For example, from the dataset we can get information  of user id, age, location, gender, movie id, director, actor, language, year, rating. After matrix factorization, the model can learns users' agfe group, such as under 10, 10- 18, 18- 30, etc. For movie feature, it can also learns that decade, director, and actor are most important. However, if looking into the information we have, decade is not a known feature from the dataset.\n",
